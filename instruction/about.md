## Our Story
Born from the understanding that meaningful learning happens through interaction, Classroom Interactive was created to solve a fundamental challenge in education: how to ensure every student has a voice in the classroom.

We've designed our platform with a neo-brutalist aesthetic that's bold, accessible, and unapologetically functional—because great tools should work beautifully without getting in the way of learning.
